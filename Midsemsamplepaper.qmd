A Probability Proportionate to estimated Size (PPeS) selection of clusters from the following
list of blocks is needed. The measure of size (MOS) is the number of housing units in the
block at the last Census. The “Cumulative” column is the cumulated sum of measures of size.
Block Cluster Number MOS Cumulative
1 50 50
2 20 70
3 25 95
4 70 165
5 100 265
6 80 345
7 55 400
8 50 450
9 40 490
10 60 550
550

## a. Ensure that each cluster has a minimum Measure of Size (MOS) of at least 35. Fill in the “Cluster Number” column to show how you have formed linked clusters.

To ensure that each cluster has a minimum Measure of Size (MOS) of at least 35, we need to form linked clusters for any block with an MOS below this threshold. We will iterate through the list and combine consecutive blocks until the cumulative MOS for a cluster is 35 or greater.
Here's how we can form the linked clusters and fill in the “Cluster Number” column:
•
Block 1: MOS = 50 (>= 35). This forms Cluster 1.
•
Block 2: MOS = 20 (< 35). This needs to be linked with subsequent blocks.
◦
Block 2 (MOS 20) + Block 3 (MOS 25) = Cumulative MOS 45 (>= 35). These two blocks form Cluster 2.
•
Block 4: MOS = 70 (>= 35). This forms Cluster 3.
•
Block 5: MOS = 100 (>= 35). This forms Cluster 4.
•
Block 6: MOS = 80 (>= 35). This forms Cluster 5.
•
Block 7: MOS = 55 (>= 35). This forms Cluster 6.
•
Block 8: MOS = 50 (>= 35). This forms Cluster 7.
•
Block 9: MOS = 40 (>= 35). This forms Cluster 8.
•
Block 10: MOS = 60 (>= 35). This forms Cluster 9.
Now, let's fill in the "Cluster Number" column based on these linked clusters:

Block	Cluster Number	MOS	Cumulative
1	1	50	50
2	2	20	70
3	2	25	95
4	3	70	165
5	4	100	265
6	5	80	345
7	6	55	400
8	7	50	450
9	8	40	490
10	9	60	550


As discussed in the sources regarding undersized units in PPeS sampling, one approach is to link undersize units to form linked units of minimum sufficient size. In area sampling, this often involves linking geographically contiguous units. Here, since we don't have geographical information, we've linked consecutive blocks based on their position in the list.
This process ensures that all formed clusters now have an MOS of at least 35, which is a prerequisite for proceeding with PPeS selection. The total number of clusters has been reduced from 10 to 9 through this linking process.



## b. What is the selection interval (k)? What range of numbers is valid for a random start in this case? Select 3 clusters using a random start of 12. Which three clusters did you select?

To perform a Probability Proportionate to estimated Size (PPeS) selection of 3 clusters from the linked clusters we formed, we will use systematic sampling.

Calculate the selection interval (k): The total Measure of Size (MOS) for all the blocks is 550 [previous turn]. We want to select 3 clusters. The selection interval (k) is calculated as: $k = \frac{\text{Total MOS}}{\text{Number of selected clusters}} = \frac{550}{3} = 183.33$

Determine the valid range for a random start: The valid range for a random start (RN) is from 1 to k, inclusive. Therefore, the valid range is 1 to 183.33. Since the random start should be an integer, the valid range for the random start is 1 to 183.


Select 3 clusters using a random start of 12: Our random start (RN) is 12. We will now select the clusters based on the cumulative MOS of the linked clusters:
◦
First selected cluster: The random start is 12. This falls within the cumulative MOS range of 1 to 50, which corresponds to Cluster 1.
◦
Second selected cluster: We add the selection interval (k) to the random start: $12 + 183.33 = 195.33$. This value falls within the cumulative MOS range of 166 to 235 (hypothetically extending the cumulative MOS of Cluster 3 by k), which corresponds to Cluster 3.
◦
Third selected cluster: We add the selection interval (k) again: $195.33 + 183.33 = 378.66$. This value falls within the cumulative MOS range of 266 to 365 (hypothetically extending the cumulative MOS of Cluster 4 by k), which corresponds to Cluster 4.
Therefore, the three clusters selected using a random start of 12 are Cluster 1, Cluster 3, and Cluster 4.


## c. Calculate the probability of selection for each of the three selected clusters.



To calculate the probability of selection for each of the three selected clusters (Cluster 1, Cluster 3, and Cluster 4) in our Probability Proportionate to estimated Size (PPeS) systematic sampling, we use the formula for the inclusion probability in PPeS:
$\pi_i = \frac{n \cdot MOS_i}{\sum MOS}$
where:
•$\pi_i$ is the probability of selection for cluster $i$.
•$n$ is the number of clusters selected (in our case, $n = 3$).
•$MOS_i$ is the Measure of Size for cluster $i$.
•$\sum MOS$ is the total Measure of Size for all blocks (in our case, $\sum MOS = 550$).
Now, let's calculate the probability of selection for each of the three selected clusters:
•Cluster 1:
◦MOS of Cluster 1 = 50
◦Probability of selection for Cluster 1 = $\frac{3 \cdot 50}{550} = \frac{150}{550} = \frac{15}{55} = \frac{3}{11} \approx 0.2727$
•Cluster 3:
◦The original Block 4 formed Cluster 3, with an MOS of 70.
◦MOS of Cluster 3 = 70
◦Probability of selection for Cluster 3 = $\frac{3 \cdot 70}{550} = \frac{210}{550} = \frac{21}{55} \approx 0.3818$
•Cluster 4:
◦The original Block 5 formed Cluster 4, with an MOS of 100.
◦MOS of Cluster 4 = 100
◦Probability of selection for Cluster 4 = $\frac{3 \cdot 100}{550} = \frac{300}{550} = \frac{30}{55} = \frac{6}{11} \approx 0.5455$
Therefore, the probabilities of selection for the three selected clusters are approximately:
•Cluster 1: $\frac{3}{11}$ or approximately 0.2727
•Cluster 3: $\frac{21}{55}$ or approximately 0.3818
•Cluster 4: $\frac{6}{11}$ or approximately 0.5455
As mentioned in the sources, in PPS sampling, larger clusters have higher probabilities of being selected because their MOS is larger. This is reflected in our calculated probabilities, where Cluster 4 (with the largest MOS of the three) has the highest probability of selection.

The formula is straightforward:

Probability of selection = (Number of clusters we're selecting × Size of the cluster) ÷ (Total size of all clusters)

Using the formula: Probability = (n × MOS_i) ÷ (Total MOS)


Cluster 1:
Size (MOS) = 50
Calculation: (3 × 50) ÷ 550 = 150 ÷ 550 = 0.2727 (or about 27%)
This means Cluster 1 had about a 27% chance of being selected
Cluster 3:
Size (MOS) = 70
Calculation: (3 × 70) ÷ 550 = 210 ÷ 550 = 0.3818 (or about 38%)
This means Cluster 3 had about a 38% chance of being selected
Cluster 4:
Size (MOS) = 100
Calculation: (3 × 100) ÷ 550 = 300 ÷ 550 = 0.5455 (or about 55%)
This means Cluster 4 had about a 55% chance of being selected.
