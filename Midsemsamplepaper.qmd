A Probability Proportionate to estimated Size (PPeS) selection of clusters from the following
list of blocks is needed. The measure of size (MOS) is the number of housing units in the
block at the last Census. The “Cumulative” column is the cumulated sum of measures of size.
Block Cluster Number MOS Cumulative
1 50 50
2 20 70
3 25 95
4 70 165
5 100 265
6 80 345
7 55 400
8 50 450
9 40 490
10 60 550
550

## a. Ensure that each cluster has a minimum Measure of Size (MOS) of at least 35. Fill in the “Cluster Number” column to show how you have formed linked clusters.

To ensure that each cluster has a minimum Measure of Size (MOS) of at least 35, we need to form linked clusters for any block with an MOS below this threshold. We will iterate through the list and combine consecutive blocks until the cumulative MOS for a cluster is 35 or greater.
Here's how we can form the linked clusters and fill in the “Cluster Number” column:
•
Block 1: MOS = 50 (>= 35). This forms Cluster 1.
•
Block 2: MOS = 20 (< 35). This needs to be linked with subsequent blocks.
◦
Block 2 (MOS 20) + Block 3 (MOS 25) = Cumulative MOS 45 (>= 35). These two blocks form Cluster 2.
•
Block 4: MOS = 70 (>= 35). This forms Cluster 3.
•
Block 5: MOS = 100 (>= 35). This forms Cluster 4.
•
Block 6: MOS = 80 (>= 35). This forms Cluster 5.
•
Block 7: MOS = 55 (>= 35). This forms Cluster 6.
•
Block 8: MOS = 50 (>= 35). This forms Cluster 7.
•
Block 9: MOS = 40 (>= 35). This forms Cluster 8.
•
Block 10: MOS = 60 (>= 35). This forms Cluster 9.
Now, let's fill in the "Cluster Number" column based on these linked clusters:

Block	Cluster Number	MOS	Cumulative
1	1	50	50
2	2	20	70
3	2	25	95
4	3	70	165
5	4	100	265
6	5	80	345
7	6	55	400
8	7	50	450
9	8	40	490
10	9	60	550


As discussed in the sources regarding undersized units in PPeS sampling, one approach is to link undersize units to form linked units of minimum sufficient size. In area sampling, this often involves linking geographically contiguous units. Here, since we don't have geographical information, we've linked consecutive blocks based on their position in the list.
This process ensures that all formed clusters now have an MOS of at least 35, which is a prerequisite for proceeding with PPeS selection. The total number of clusters has been reduced from 10 to 9 through this linking process.



## b. What is the selection interval (k)? What range of numbers is valid for a random start in this case? Select 3 clusters using a random start of 12. Which three clusters did you select?

To perform a Probability Proportionate to estimated Size (PPeS) selection of 3 clusters from the linked clusters we formed, we will use systematic sampling.

Calculate the selection interval (k): The total Measure of Size (MOS) for all the blocks is 550 [previous turn]. We want to select 3 clusters. The selection interval (k) is calculated as: $k = \frac{\text{Total MOS}}{\text{Number of selected clusters}} = \frac{550}{3} = 183.33$

Determine the valid range for a random start: The valid range for a random start (RN) is from 1 to k, inclusive. Therefore, the valid range is 1 to 183.33. Since the random start should be an integer, the valid range for the random start is 1 to 183.


Select 3 clusters using a random start of 12: Our random start (RN) is 12. We will now select the clusters based on the cumulative MOS of the linked clusters:
◦First selected cluster: The random start is 12. This falls within the cumulative MOS range of 1 to 50, which corresponds to Cluster 1.
◦Second selected cluster: We add the selection interval (k) to the random start: $12 + 183.33 = 195.33$. This value falls within the cumulative MOS range of 166 to 235 (hypothetically extending the cumulative MOS of Cluster 3 by k), which corresponds to Cluster 3.
◦Third selected cluster: We add the selection interval (k) again: $195.33 + 183.33 = 378.66$. This value falls within the cumulative MOS range of 266 to 365 (hypothetically extending the cumulative MOS of Cluster 4 by k), which corresponds to Cluster 4.
Therefore, the three clusters selected using a random start of 12 are Cluster 1, Cluster 3, and Cluster 4.


## c. Calculate the probability of selection for each of the three selected clusters.


The formula is straightforward:

Probability of selection = (Number of clusters we're selecting × Size of the cluster) ÷ (Total size of all clusters)

Using the formula: Probability = (n × MOS_i) ÷ (Total MOS)


Cluster 1:
Size (MOS) = 50
Calculation: (3 × 50) ÷ 550 = 150 ÷ 550 = 0.2727 (or about 27%)
This means Cluster 1 had about a 27% chance of being selected
Cluster 3:
Size (MOS) = 70
Calculation: (3 × 70) ÷ 550 = 210 ÷ 550 = 0.3818 (or about 38%)
This means Cluster 3 had about a 38% chance of being selected
Cluster 4:
Size (MOS) = 100
Calculation: (3 × 100) ÷ 550 = 300 ÷ 550 = 0.5455 (or about 55%)
This means Cluster 4 had about a 55% chance of being selected.


## d. The desired overall sampling rate (f) is 48/550. Calculate the required subsampling rate for each of the selected clusters that will produce an epsem sample of housing units.

The Basic Formula
The overall chance of selecting any housing unit = (Chance of selecting its cluster) × (Chance of selecting that unit within its cluster)

For EPSEM, we want this overall chance to be the same (48/550) for every housing unit.

How We Do It
We know the desired overall sampling rate: 48/550 (about 8.7%)

We know each cluster's selection probability (π)
We calculate each cluster's subsampling rate (r) using: r = (overall rate) ÷ (cluster probability)

In Simple Terms for Each Cluster
Cluster 1:
Was selected with 27% probability (3/11)

To achieve our target 8.7% overall rate:
We need to sample 32% of housing units within this cluster
Because: 27% × 32% ≈ 8.7%

Cluster 3:
Was selected with 38% probability (21/55)
To achieve our target 8.7% overall rate:
We need to sample about 23% of housing units within this cluster
Because: 38% × 23% ≈ 8.7%

Cluster 4:
Was selected with 55% probability (6/11)
To achieve our target 8.7% overall rate:
We need to sample 16% of housing units within this cluster
Because: 55% × 16% ≈ 8.7%





2. Consider the following frame of blocks
Block Cluster Number MOS Cumulative MOS
1 50 50
2 10 60
3 63 123
4 0 123
5 22 145
6 52 197
7 0 197
8 28 225
9 100 325
10 75 400


## a. Select 2 blocks with probabilities proportionate to size, using a minimum size of 50. Use systematic selections with a random start of 75.0. If linking is necessary, identify the linked units in the appropriate column.

Step 1: Link Small Blocks Together
Some blocks are too small (less than 50 MOS), so we need to link them with neighbors until they reach our minimum size:

Block 1 (MOS = 50): Already big enough → Cluster 1
Blocks 2+3 (MOS = 10+63 = 73): Linked together → Cluster 2
Blocks 4+5+6 (MOS = 0+22+52 = 74): Linked together → Cluster 3
Blocks 7+8+9 (MOS = 0+28+100 = 128): Linked together → Cluster 4
Block 10 (MOS = 75): Already big enough → Cluster 5

## So here, you have to combine with the adjacent next wala accordingly 
Now instead of 10 possibly undersized blocks, we have 5 clusters all meeting our minimum size requirement.

Step 2: Set Up the Systematic Selection
Total MOS = 400
We need to select 2 clusters
Selection interval = 400 ÷ 2 = 200
Random start = 75 (given in the problem)
Step 3: Make the Selections
Think of the MOS as stretching along a number line from 1 to 400. Each cluster occupies a portion:

Cluster 1: 1-50
Cluster 2: 51-123
Cluster 3: 124-197
Cluster 4: 198-325
Cluster 5: 326-400


Now we place our selection points:

First selection point = 75 → Falls in range 51-123 → Select Cluster 2 (Blocks 2 & 3)
Second selection point = 75 + 200 = 275 → Falls in range 198-325 → Select Cluster 4 (Blocks 7, 8 & 9)
Summary
We selected:

Cluster 2: Blocks 2 and 3 (MOS = 73)
Cluster 4: Blocks 7, 8, and 9 (MOS = 128)
The linking was necessary because of our minimum size requirement. By linking smaller blocks together, we ensured that each potential selection had a sufficient size, while still maintaining the probability proportionate to size principle.
