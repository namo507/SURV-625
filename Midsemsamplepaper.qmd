A Probability Proportionate to estimated Size (PPeS) selection of clusters from the following
list of blocks is needed. The measure of size (MOS) is the number of housing units in the
block at the last Census. The “Cumulative” column is the cumulated sum of measures of size.
Block Cluster Number MOS Cumulative
1 50 50
2 20 70
3 25 95
4 70 165
5 100 265
6 80 345
7 55 400
8 50 450
9 40 490
10 60 550
550

## a. Ensure that each cluster has a minimum Measure of Size (MOS) of at least 35. Fill in the “Cluster Number” column to show how you have formed linked clusters.

To ensure that each cluster has a minimum Measure of Size (MOS) of at least 35, we need to form linked clusters for any block with an MOS below this threshold. We will iterate through the list and combine consecutive blocks until the cumulative MOS for a cluster is 35 or greater.
Here's how we can form the linked clusters and fill in the “Cluster Number” column:
•
Block 1: MOS = 50 (>= 35). This forms Cluster 1.
•
Block 2: MOS = 20 (< 35). This needs to be linked with subsequent blocks.
◦
Block 2 (MOS 20) + Block 3 (MOS 25) = Cumulative MOS 45 (>= 35). These two blocks form Cluster 2.
•
Block 4: MOS = 70 (>= 35). This forms Cluster 3.
•
Block 5: MOS = 100 (>= 35). This forms Cluster 4.
•
Block 6: MOS = 80 (>= 35). This forms Cluster 5.
•
Block 7: MOS = 55 (>= 35). This forms Cluster 6.
•
Block 8: MOS = 50 (>= 35). This forms Cluster 7.
•
Block 9: MOS = 40 (>= 35). This forms Cluster 8.
•
Block 10: MOS = 60 (>= 35). This forms Cluster 9.
Now, let's fill in the "Cluster Number" column based on these linked clusters:

Block	Cluster Number	MOS	Cumulative
1	1	50	50
2	2	20	70
3	2	25	95
4	3	70	165
5	4	100	265
6	5	80	345
7	6	55	400
8	7	50	450
9	8	40	490
10	9	60	550


As discussed in the sources regarding undersized units in PPeS sampling, one approach is to link undersize units to form linked units of minimum sufficient size. In area sampling, this often involves linking geographically contiguous units. Here, since we don't have geographical information, we've linked consecutive blocks based on their position in the list.
This process ensures that all formed clusters now have an MOS of at least 35, which is a prerequisite for proceeding with PPeS selection. The total number of clusters has been reduced from 10 to 9 through this linking process.



## b. What is the selection interval (k)? What range of numbers is valid for a random start in this case? Select 3 clusters using a random start of 12. Which three clusters did you select?

To perform a Probability Proportionate to estimated Size (PPeS) selection of 3 clusters from the linked clusters we formed, we will use systematic sampling.

Calculate the selection interval (k): The total Measure of Size (MOS) for all the blocks is 550 [previous turn]. We want to select 3 clusters. The selection interval (k) is calculated as: $k = \frac{\text{Total MOS}}{\text{Number of selected clusters}} = \frac{550}{3} = 183.33$

Determine the valid range for a random start: The valid range for a random start (RN) is from 1 to k, inclusive. Therefore, the valid range is 1 to 183.33. Since the random start should be an integer, the valid range for the random start is 1 to 183.


Select 3 clusters using a random start of 12: Our random start (RN) is 12. We will now select the clusters based on the cumulative MOS of the linked clusters:
◦First selected cluster: The random start is 12. This falls within the cumulative MOS range of 1 to 50, which corresponds to Cluster 1.
◦Second selected cluster: We add the selection interval (k) to the random start: $12 + 183.33 = 195.33$. This value falls within the cumulative MOS range of 166 to 235 (hypothetically extending the cumulative MOS of Cluster 3 by k), which corresponds to Cluster 3.
◦Third selected cluster: We add the selection interval (k) again: $195.33 + 183.33 = 378.66$. This value falls within the cumulative MOS range of 266 to 365 (hypothetically extending the cumulative MOS of Cluster 4 by k), which corresponds to Cluster 4.
Therefore, the three clusters selected using a random start of 12 are Cluster 1, Cluster 3, and Cluster 4.


## c. Calculate the probability of selection for each of the three selected clusters.


The formula is straightforward:

Probability of selection = (Number of clusters we're selecting × Size of the cluster) ÷ (Total size of all clusters)

Using the formula: Probability = (n × MOS_i) ÷ (Total MOS)


Cluster 1:
Size (MOS) = 50
Calculation: (3 × 50) ÷ 550 = 150 ÷ 550 = 0.2727 (or about 27%)
This means Cluster 1 had about a 27% chance of being selected
Cluster 3:
Size (MOS) = 70
Calculation: (3 × 70) ÷ 550 = 210 ÷ 550 = 0.3818 (or about 38%)
This means Cluster 3 had about a 38% chance of being selected
Cluster 4:
Size (MOS) = 100
Calculation: (3 × 100) ÷ 550 = 300 ÷ 550 = 0.5455 (or about 55%)
This means Cluster 4 had about a 55% chance of being selected.


## d. The desired overall sampling rate (f) is 48/550. Calculate the required subsampling rate for each of the selected clusters that will produce an epsem sample of housing units.

The Basic Formula
The overall chance of selecting any housing unit = (Chance of selecting its cluster) × (Chance of selecting that unit within its cluster)

For EPSEM, we want this overall chance to be the same (48/550) for every housing unit.

How We Do It
We know the desired overall sampling rate: 48/550 (about 8.7%)

We know each cluster's selection probability (π)
We calculate each cluster's subsampling rate (r) using: r = (overall rate) ÷ (cluster probability)

In Simple Terms for Each Cluster
Cluster 1:
Was selected with 27% probability (3/11)

To achieve our target 8.7% overall rate:
We need to sample 32% of housing units within this cluster
Because: 27% × 32% ≈ 8.7%

Cluster 3:
Was selected with 38% probability (21/55)
To achieve our target 8.7% overall rate:
We need to sample about 23% of housing units within this cluster
Because: 38% × 23% ≈ 8.7%

Cluster 4:
Was selected with 55% probability (6/11)
To achieve our target 8.7% overall rate:
We need to sample 16% of housing units within this cluster
Because: 55% × 16% ≈ 8.7%





2. Consider the following frame of blocks
Block Cluster Number MOS Cumulative MOS
1 50 50
2 10 60
3 63 123
4 0 123
5 22 145
6 52 197
7 0 197
8 28 225
9 100 325
10 75 400


## a. Select 2 blocks with probabilities proportionate to size, using a minimum size of 50. Use systematic selections with a random start of 75.0. If linking is necessary, identify the linked units in the appropriate column.

Step 1: Link Small Blocks Together
Some blocks are too small (less than 50 MOS), so we need to link them with neighbors until they reach our minimum size:

Block 1 (MOS = 50): Already big enough → Cluster 1
Blocks 2+3 (MOS = 10+63 = 73): Linked together → Cluster 2
Blocks 4+5+6 (MOS = 0+22+52 = 74): Linked together → Cluster 3
Blocks 7+8+9 (MOS = 0+28+100 = 128): Linked together → Cluster 4
Block 10 (MOS = 75): Already big enough → Cluster 5

## So here, you have to combine with the adjacent next wala accordingly 
Now instead of 10 possibly undersized blocks, we have 5 clusters all meeting our minimum size requirement.

Step 2: Set Up the Systematic Selection
Total MOS = 400
We need to select 2 clusters
Selection interval = 400 ÷ 2 = 200
Random start = 75 (given in the problem)
Step 3: Make the Selections
Think of the MOS as stretching along a number line from 1 to 400. Each cluster occupies a portion:

Cluster 1: 1-50
Cluster 2: 51-123
Cluster 3: 124-197
Cluster 4: 198-325
Cluster 5: 326-400


Now we place our selection points:

First selection point = 75 → Falls in range 51-123 → Select Cluster 2 (Blocks 2 & 3)
Second selection point = 75 + 200 = 275 → Falls in range 198-325 → Select Cluster 4 (Blocks 7, 8 & 9)
Summary
We selected:

Cluster 2: Blocks 2 and 3 (MOS = 73)
Cluster 4: Blocks 7, 8, and 9 (MOS = 128)
The linking was necessary because of our minimum size requirement. By linking smaller blocks together, we ensured that each potential selection had a sufficient size, while still maintaining the probability proportionate to size principle.


## b. Give the probability of selection for the primary selections (i.e., the clusters formed from the blocks) made in problem (i).

The Simple Formula
The formula for finding the probability of selecting a cluster is:

Probability = (Number of clusters we're selecting × Size of the cluster) ÷ (Total size of all clusters)

For Our Selected Clusters
We selected 2 clusters out of 5 possible clusters, with a total MOS of 400.

Cluster 2 (Blocks 2 & 3):
Size (MOS) = 73
Calculation: (2 × 73) ÷ 400 = 146 ÷ 400 = 0.365 (about 36.5%)
This means Cluster 2 had about a 36.5% chance of being selected
Cluster 4 (Blocks 7, 8 & 9):
Size (MOS) = 128
Calculation: (2 × 128) ÷ 400 = 256 ÷ 400 = 0.64 (64%)
This means Cluster 4 had a 64% chance of being selected
Why This Makes Sense
Cluster 4 is almost twice as large as Cluster 2 (128 vs 73), so it had almost twice the chance of being selected (64% vs 36.5%). This shows how PPS sampling works - larger clusters have proportionally larger chances of being selected.

These probabilities are important because they help us understand how representative our sample is and how to properly weight the results when analyzing the data.


## c. The overall probability of selection is f = 0.05. Give the within-cluster selection rate for each cluster selected in Part 2a that will result in an epsem sample of housing units.


The Simple Formula
For EPSEM sampling, we use this formula: Within-cluster selection rate = Overall sampling rate ÷ Cluster selection probability

Since the overall sampling rate (f) is given as 0.05 (or 5%), and we know the selection probabilities for each cluster from part b, we can calculate:

For Our Selected Clusters
Cluster 2 (Blocks 2 & 3):
Selection probability: 0.365 (36.5%)
Within-cluster rate = 0.05 ÷ 0.365 = 0.137 (about 13.7%)
This means we need to sample about 13.7% of housing units in Cluster 2
Cluster 4 (Blocks 7, 8 & 9):
Selection probability: 0.64 (64%)
Within-cluster rate = 0.05 ÷ 0.64 = 0.078 (about 7.8%)
This means we need to sample about 7.8% of housing units in Cluster 4
Why This Makes Sense
Cluster 4 had a higher chance of being selected (64% vs 36.5%), so we need to sample a smaller percentage of its units to balance things out. This creates our EPSEM design where every housing unit in the population ends up with the same 5% chance of being in our final sample.

The final result:

We sample 13.7% of units from Cluster 2
We sample 7.8% of units from Cluster 4
This ensures every housing unit in the population has exactly a 5% chance of being selected, regardless of which cluster it belongs to.


## d. After selecting clusters, field staff are sent to selected blocks to count the number of housing units that are actually there. Suppose the (potentially linked) cluster 2 is selected and the real # of housing units is 95, calculate the expected number of housing units to be selected in cluster 2 given the actual counts.


The Basic Approach
We already determined in part (c) that we need to sample 13.7% of housing units in Cluster 2 to maintain an EPSEM design. Now we just apply this percentage to the actual count.

Simple Calculation Steps
We know:

The actual number of housing units in Cluster 2 = 95
The within-cluster selection rate for Cluster 2 = 13.7% (or 0.137)
To calculate the number of housing units to select:

Number of units to select = Actual count × Selection rate
Number of units to select = 95 × 0.137 = 13.01
Since we can't select a partial housing unit, we would round to 13 housing units.



## 3. Tables in Question 1 and Question 2 are the sample frame from two strata. 
## • For Stratum 1: three clusters were selected, i.e., 𝑛! = 3 
## • For Stratum 2: two clusters were selected, i.e., 𝑛" = 2 

## a. What are stratum-specific zone size?


We have sample frames from two strata:

Stratum 1: Table in Question 1 (10 blocks with total MOS = 550)
Stratum 2: Table in Question 2 (10 blocks with total MOS = 400)
We need to determine the "zone size" for each stratum, knowing:

For Stratum 1: Three clusters were selected (n₁ = 3)
For Stratum 2: Two clusters were selected (n₂ = 2)
What is Zone Size?
In PPS/PPeS sampling, the "zone size" is the selection interval (k), which is calculated as: Zone Size (k) = Total MOS ÷ Number of selections

Simple Calculation Steps
For Stratum 1:
Total MOS = 550 (sum of all MOS values in Question 1)
Number of selections (n₁) = 3
Zone Size = 550 ÷ 3 = 183.33
For Stratum 2:
Total MOS = 400 (sum of all MOS values in Question 2)
Number of selections (n₂) = 2
Zone Size = 400 ÷ 2 = 200
Answer
The stratum-specific zone sizes are:

Stratum 1: 183.33
Stratum 2: 200


## b. To retain epsem with the desired overall sampling rate (f = 0.1), what is the targeted subsample size for each cluster in Stratum 1?

Part B: Targeted Subsample Size for Each Cluster in Stratum 1
Step 1: Identify the Selected Clusters
From part 1b, we selected Clusters 1, 3, and 4 in Stratum 1 with:

Cluster 1: MOS = 50
Cluster 3: MOS = 70
Cluster 4: MOS = 100
Step 2: Calculate the Selection Probability for Each Cluster
Using the formula: Selection probability = (n × Cluster MOS) ÷ Total MOS

Cluster 1: (3 × 50) ÷ 550 = 150 ÷ 550 = 0.2727
Cluster 3: (3 × 70) ÷ 550 = 210 ÷ 550 = 0.3818
Cluster 4: (3 × 100) ÷ 550 = 300 ÷ 550 = 0.5455
Step 3: Calculate the Within-Cluster Sampling Rate
Using the formula: Within-cluster rate = Overall rate ÷ Selection probability

Cluster 1: 0.1 ÷ 0.2727 = 0.3667 (36.67%)
Cluster 3: 0.1 ÷ 0.3818 = 0.2619 (26.19%)
Cluster 4: 0.1 ÷ 0.5455 = 0.1833 (18.33%)
Step 4: Calculate the Subsample Size for Each Cluster
Since we're asked for the targeted subsample size, we multiply the within-cluster rate by the MOS:

Cluster 1: 50 × 0.3667 = 18.33 ≈ 18 units
Cluster 3: 70 × 0.2619 = 18.33 ≈ 18 units
Cluster 4: 100 × 0.1833 = 18.33 ≈ 18 units

## c. To retain epsem with the desired overall sampling rate (f = 0.1), what is the targeted subsample size for each cluster in Stratum 2?

Step 1: Identify the Selected Clusters
From part 2a, we selected Clusters 2 and 4 in Stratum 2 with:

Cluster 2: MOS = 73 (Blocks 2 & 3)
Cluster 4: MOS = 128 (Blocks 7, 8 & 9)
Step 2: Calculate the Selection Probability for Each Cluster
Using the formula: Selection probability = (n × Cluster MOS) ÷ Total MOS

Cluster 2: (2 × 73) ÷ 400 = 146 ÷ 400 = 0.365
Cluster 4: (2 × 128) ÷ 400 = 256 ÷ 400 = 0.64
Step 3: Calculate the Within-Cluster Sampling Rate
Using the formula: Within-cluster rate = Overall rate ÷ Selection probability

Cluster 2: 0.1 ÷ 0.365 = 0.2740 (27.40%)
Cluster 4: 0.1 ÷ 0.64 = 0.1563 (15.63%)
Step 4: Calculate the Subsample Size for Each Cluster
Multiplying the within-cluster rate by the MOS:

Cluster 2: 73 × 0.2740 = 20 units
Cluster 4: 128 × 0.1563 = 20 units



## True or False
## a. (TRUE / FALSE) The Taylor Series Linearization method for estimating the sampling variance of an estimated mean is necessary when selecting a simple random sample of n clusters from a total population of N clusters, and a simple random sample of m elements from the M population elements in each of the n randomly sampled clusters.


FALSE. While Taylor Series Linearization is a method for variance estimation in complex surveys, the sources indicate that for two-stage cluster sampling with equal-sized clusters, the sampling variance can be estimated using formulas that consider the between-cluster and within-cluster variances. These formulas are derived without explicitly stating the necessity of Taylor Series Linearization for this specific design.

Taylor Series Linearization is typically necessary for more complex statistics (like ratios, regression coefficients) or complex sampling designs.


## b. (TRUE / FALSE) The use of weights in analyses (whatever introduced the need to use them) will generally tend to increase the sampling variance of estimates, and the more variable the weights are, the higher the increase.

TRUE. Source explicitly states that "The use of weights in estimation can increase the sampling variance of weighted estimates (part of the design effect)". Furthermore, it introduces the concept of loss of precision due to weighting ($L = C^2(weights)$), which implies that greater variability in weights (higher $C^2$) leads to a larger potential increase in sampling variance.

The design effect due to weighting is approximately 1 + CV² (where CV is the coefficient of variation of the weights). More variable weights lead to larger increases in variance.


## c. (TRUE / FALSE) Under certain assumptions, one can compute the size of a simple random sample needed to achieve a certain level of sampling variance for a given estimated mean if the only two pieces of information provided are 1) the desired level of sampling variance and 2) an estimate of the element variance.

TRUE. Source discusses sample size projection for Simple Random Sampling (SRS). It mentions that the desired precision is often expressed in terms of the margin of error ($e$), which is related to the desired sampling variance. The formula $n_0 = z^2_{\alpha/2} \hat{S}^2 / e^2$ shows that if we have a desired level of precision (related to sampling variance via $e$) and an estimate of the element variance ($\hat{S}^2$), we can calculate the required sample size ($n_0$).


For simple random sampling, the formula n = S²/V (where S² is the element variance and V is the desired sampling variance) can be used to determine the required sample size. This assumes the population is large relative to the sample size.


## d. (TRUE / FALSE) With unequal-sized clusters and a fixed subsample size b within each cluster, the simple unweighted mean can still be used as an unbiased estimate of the population mean.

FALSE. When clusters are of unequal sizes and a fixed number of elements are sampled from each, the selection probabilities for individual elements are not equal, meaning the design is not EPSEM (equal probability of selection method). In such cases, a simple unweighted mean would generally be a biased estimate of the population mean. Source suggests that in such scenarios, weights would be needed to account for the unequal probabilities of selection.

using a simple unweighted mean would give elements in smaller clusters greater weight than those in larger clusters, leading to bias. Weighting is necessary to produce an unbiased estimate.

## e. (TRUE / FALSE) The approximation of the variance when using Taylor Series Linearization is adequate for inference if the coefficient of variation of the sample size is 0.8.

FALSE. Source discusses the adequacy of the Taylor series approximation for variance estimation in the context of unequal-sized cluster sampling. It states that the approximation is reasonably accurate if the coefficient of variation of the sample size (sum of weights within clusters) is less than 0.1, and values up to 0.2 might be acceptable. A coefficient of variation of 0.8 is significantly higher than these recommended thresholds, indicating that the approximation would likely not be adequate for reliable inference.

A coefficient of variation of 0.8 (80%) for sample size is quite high, indicating substantial variability in sample sizes. This high variability would likely compromise the accuracy of Taylor Series Linearization, which works best when the coefficient of variation is small (typically less than 0.2 or 20%).

## f. (TRUE / FALSE) In determining the number of clusters selected in stratified cluster sampling, allocation proportionate to the number of elements in a stratum in the population facilitates self-weighting element selection.

FALSE. Source clarifies that in stratified cluster sampling, proportionate allocation usually refers to elements, not clusters, and this is what allows us to maintain epsem for the elements. Allocating the number of clusters proportionate to the number of elements in a stratum does not guarantee that the probability of selecting each element will be equal, especially if the clusters are of unequal sizes.

## g. (TRUE / FALSE) If the elements in a list are approximately continuously ordered and an odd number of units is selected using systematic random sampling, the paired selection model can be used for variance estimation.

FALSE. Source indicates that if the elements in the list are approximately continuously ordered and an odd number of units is selected using systematic random sampling, the successive differences model is more appropriate for variance estimation. The paired selection model is suggested when an even sample size is drawn under similar ordering assumptions.

With an odd number of selections, one unit would be left unpaired, making the standard paired selection approach difficult to apply directly.



## h. (TRUE / FALSE) If one selects all possible elements within a cluster that has been selected using simple random sampling (i.e., clusters were selected with equal probability), but the clusters are of unequal sizes, selection probabilities will vary for different population elements.

TRUE. If clusters of unequal sizes are selected with equal probability, and all elements within the selected clusters are included in the sample, then an element in a smaller cluster has a higher probability of being selected than an element in a larger cluster. This is because each cluster has the same probability of selection, but the number of elements contributed to the sample differs.



## i. (TRUE / FALSE) The sampling variance under “ultimate cluster” sampling mimics the sampling variance under with replacement selection of primary stage clusters and without replacement subsampling of elements within the clusters.

TRUE. Source describes that the ultimate cluster idea leads to an approximation of the sampling variance and notes that it is similar to a two-stage selection where the first stage (selection of clusters) is with replacement. While the term "mimics" is used, the core concept of ultimate clusters simplifies variance estimation by focusing on the variability between these ultimate clusters, which aligns with the variance estimation under with-replacement PSU selection.

Ultimate cluster sampling approximates this scenario because it assumes with-replacement selection at higher stages and without-replacement subsampling at lower stages.


## j. (TRUE / FALSE) Varying the subsample size m in two-stage cluster sampling by design will impact the rate of homogeneity, design effects and thus effective sample sizes.

TRUE. While the rate of homogeneity ($\rho$) is a characteristic of the population and the defined clusters, the design effect ($DEFF = 1 + (m-1) \rho$) is directly influenced by the subsample size $m$. Since the effective sample size is calculated considering the design effect (e.g., $n_{eff} \approx \frac{n \times m}{DEFF}$), varying $m$ will indeed impact the design effect and, consequently, the effective sample size.

The subsample size within clusters directly affects the design effect through its relationship with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Varying subsample sizes across clusters can change how the ICC impacts the effective sample size.



## k. (TRUE / FALSE) In theory, the estimate of sampling variance in two-stage cluster sampling includes the between-cluster and within-cluster sampling.
TRUE. Source explicitly states that the estimation of sampling variance in two-stage cluster sampling (with equal sizes) involves both the between-cluster variance and the average within-cluster sampling variance. Similarly, source for unequal-sized clusters shows variance formulas that account for variability at both stages.

## l. (TRUE / FALSE) A proportionate allocation design is epsem (ignoring rounding error).
TRUE. Source clearly states that under proportionate allocation, the sampling fraction ($n_h/N_h = n/N$) is the same across all strata, leading to an epsem design, where each element has an equal probability of selection. This holds true when ignoring rounding errors in sample sizes.
